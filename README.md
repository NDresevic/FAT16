# FAT16
FAT16 simulation written in Java, along with a graphical representation of data storage in the simulated cluster files of the system and sectors on the disk.

My work is FAT16, classes MockFAT, MockDirectory, DiskFile and graphical representation. 
The simulation of the file system can be done creating your own Unit tests or just running and analyzing the existing ones in 'test' folder.
The graphical represenation is done in Swing, it shows content of FAT16 table and disk, where reserved sectors are marked and their content can be shown seperately.
